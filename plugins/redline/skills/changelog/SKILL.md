# Claude Code Changelog

## Steps

1. Detect the running session's Claude Code version, NOT the version on PATH.
   `claude --version` is unreliable here, because Claude Code self-updates in the
   background. PATH almost always points at the latest release on disk, even
   when this session still runs an older binary. The whole point of this
   command is "what release notes apply to me right now," so we have to read
   the version from the actual session process.

   Walk up the parent process tree from this Bash subprocess until we hit a
   binary at `.../versions/X.Y.Z/claude` (Claude Code's self-update layout):

   ```bash
   pid=$PPID
   for d in 1 2 3 4 5; do
     if [ -r "/proc/$pid/exe" ]; then
       exe=$(readlink "/proc/$pid/exe" 2>/dev/null)
     else
       exe=$(lsof -a -p "$pid" -d txt 2>/dev/null | awk 'NR>1 {print $NF; exit}')
     fi
     installed=$(printf '%s' "$exe" | grep -oE 'versions/[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' | head -1 | cut -d/ -f2)
     [ -n "$installed" ] && break
     pid=$(ps -o ppid= -p "$pid" 2>/dev/null | tr -d ' ')
     { [ -z "$pid" ] || [ "$pid" = "0" ] || [ "$pid" = "1" ]; } && break
   done
   echo "session version: ${installed:-unknown}"
   ```

   If the walk returns nothing (e.g. custom install not at a versioned path),
   fall back to `claude --version` and note in the output that this is the
   PATH version, which is not always the version this session runs.

2. Get the latest published version: `npm view @anthropic-ai/claude-code version`

3. Fetch recent releases from GitHub:
   ```bash
   gh release list --repo anthropics/claude-code --limit 10
   ```

4. If the session version is behind the latest, highlight that **restarting
   the session** will pick up the newer binary (Claude Code self-updates on
   disk in the background, so you rarely need to run `npm update`. Just exit
   and relaunch). Only suggest `npm update -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
   if the on-disk version is also behind, which the user can check with
   `claude --version`.

5. Show the release notes for releases newer than the session version. For each release, use:
   ```bash
   gh release view <tag> --repo anthropics/claude-code
   ```

   Present the output in a clean, readable format. Put the version in a header, and keep the body as it is.

6. If the session already runs the latest version, say so. Show notes for the
   most recent 2-3 releases anyway.
